# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project is a classic beginner-friendly machine learning challenge based on the famous Titanic disaster of 1912. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not using features such as age, gender, class, and more.

## 💡 Project Highlights

- Data Cleaning & EDA with **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**
- Feature Engineering to handle missing values, categories, and more
- Model Training using **RandomForestClassifier**
- Evaluation and accuracy analysis
- Submission file generation for **Kaggle Titanic Competition**

> "My model couldn't save Jack... but it did save ~80% of the passengers. That counts, right? 😉"

## 📂 Files Included

- `train.csv`, `test.csv` – Titanic dataset
- `titanic_notebook.ipynb` – Full Jupyter Notebook
- `titanic_submission.csv` – Final output for Kaggle submission

## 📸 Sample Visualizations

<ul>
  <li>Survival Rate by Sex</li>
  <li>Age Distribution</li>
  <li>Feature Importance from Random Forest</li>
</ul>

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
